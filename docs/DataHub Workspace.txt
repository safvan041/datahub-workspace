Project Requirements Document: DataHub Workspace
Version: 1.0

Date: July 29, 2025

Author: Safwan

Status: Draft

1. Vision & Introduction
DataHub Workspace is a collaborative, version-controlled platform designed to streamline the most time-consuming part of machine learning: data preparation. By applying the principles of open-source software development (like version control, branching, and pull requests) to datasets, we empower data scientists and ML engineers to collaboratively clean, label, and enrich data, creating high-quality, transparent, and reproducible assets for training AI models.

2. The Problem
It is widely cited that data scientists spend up to 80% of their time finding, cleaning, and organizing data. This process is typically a solo effort, lacking transparency, versioning, and reusability. This leads to duplicated work, inconsistent datasets, and a major bottleneck in the AI development lifecycle. DataHub Workspace aims to solve this by transforming data preparation into a systematic, collaborative, and community-driven effort.

3. Target Audience (User Personas)
Priya, the Data Scientist (Contributor): Priya wants to build a strong portfolio and practice her data cleaning skills on real-world problems. She needs a platform to showcase her expertise and discover interesting datasets.

Raj, the ML Engineer (Project Owner): Raj works for a startup and needs high-quality data to train their production models. He is tired of the manual, ad-hoc cleaning process and needs a reliable, auditable way to manage his team's data assets.

Anjali, the Student (Learner): Anjali is learning data science and wants to gain practical experience beyond textbook examples. She wants to contribute to real projects to understand the nuances of data preparation.

4. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
The MVP will focus on delivering the core collaborative workflow for tabular data (CSV files).

4.1. User & Profile Management

Secure user registration and login (OAuth 2.0 with Google/GitHub).

User profiles showcasing contribution history, statistics, and areas of interest.

4.2. Data Repositories

Users can create public data repositories.

Ability to upload an initial dataset (CSV format).

A README.md file (using Markdown) to describe the dataset.

A GOAL.md file to define the project's cleaning objectives.

4.3. Version Control & Workflow

Branching: Users can create a new "branch" of a dataset to work on changes in isolation.

Committing Changes: After running a cleaning script, a user can "commit" the changes, which versions the new state of the data.

Cleaning Requests (CRs): Similar to a Pull Request on GitHub. A user can submit their branch of cleaned data back to the main repository. The CR includes a title, description of changes, and a "data diff."

Data Diff Viewer: A simple text-based or tabular view showing rows/columns that were added, removed, or modified.

Review & Merge: The repository owner can review the changes, comment, and merge the CR, updating the main dataset to the new version.

4.4. Sandboxed Script Execution

Ability to upload and run a Python cleaning script (using Pandas) associated with a commit.

Scripts will be executed in a secure, isolated Docker container to prevent security risks.

5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Security:

All web traffic must be encrypted with TLS 1.3 (HTTPS).

Data at rest must be encrypted using AES-256.

Strict sandboxing for all user-submitted code execution.

Password hashing and secure authentication practices are mandatory.

Scalability:

The platform must handle concurrent users and asynchronous job processing.

MVP will support datasets up to 1 GB.

Performance:

Core web pages should load in under 2 seconds.

Validation jobs for MVP-sized datasets should complete within 5 minutes.

Usability:

The user interface must be clean, intuitive, and familiar to anyone who has used GitHub.

6. Proposed Technology Stack
Frontend: React (with Next.js)

Backend: Go / Java (Spring Boot)

Data Processing Engine: Python (with Pandas, Dask)

Job Queuing: RabbitMQ

Sandboxing: Docker

Primary Database: PostgreSQL

Data Storage: S3-compatible Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO)

Data Versioning Framework: DVC (Data Version Control) principles

Infrastructure: Kubernetes (K8s) and Terraform

7. High-Level Architecture
The platform will operate on a microservices-based architecture. A user interacts with the React Frontend, which communicates with the Backend API. The backend manages metadata in PostgreSQL and large data files in Object Storage. When a user submits a cleaning script, the job is pushed to RabbitMQ. A pool of Python Workers listens for jobs, spins up a Docker Container to execute the script securely, and reports the results back to the user via the backend.

8. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
Phase 1 (Enhancing Core): Interactive cleaning notebooks, advanced data visualizations, support for more data formats (Images, Text, Parquet).

Phase 2 (Ecosystem Expansion): Feature Store integration, model training hooks, synthetic data generation.

Phase 3 (AI-Powered Future): AutoClean AI for suggesting cleaning scripts, natural language data discovery, automated bias detection.

9. Success Metrics (KPIs)
Activation: Number of weekly active users.

Engagement: Number of Cleaning Requests created and merged per week.

Adoption: Number of new data repositories created.

Retention: Percentage of users who return after their first contribution.
